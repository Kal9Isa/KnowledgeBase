In this course you will learn about the future evolution of communication networks towards so called 
machine-type applications, also referred to as Cyber-Physical Systems.

After completion of this course you will:
    * be able to identify and explain the requirements of control applications and CPS with respect 
    to networking solutions.
    
    * be able to match design principles of CP Networks to different application requirements.
    
    * understand and be able to explain the consequences of massive and/or critical wireless networking 
    for the higher layers of communication systems.
    
    * be able to identify major open research challanges in the context of CPNs and their implications 
    in meeting social challanges.
    
    
  Course Syllabus: 
    
  1- Requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems:
        * examples of CPS is given
        * a more formal definition and characteristics of CPS is presented.
        * the requirements of CPS and how they relate to particular networks.
        * dependability of CPS
        * traditional networks for CPS 
        * the future of networks of CPS and how a control strategy works.
        * we also look into which numerical level the corresponding networks for CPS need to meet to pass 
        latency and reliability requirements.
        
 
 2- Massive Wireless Networks for Cyber-Physical Systems:
       * we will dig deeper into low-complexity and low-power nodes
       * scheduling and duty cycling
       * access control for massive systems
       * privacy and security
       
 
 3- Critical Wireless Networking for Cyber-Physical Networking 
    * we study different approaches to overcome the corresponding challanges with availability and low-latency.
    * discuss availability and low-latencies in terms of diversity, scheduling, transceiver complexity, 
    independence control and fault tolerance.
    * security and privacy.
    
    
4- Higher-Layer Networking for Cyber-Physical Networking
    * we study higher layer aspects of CPS, particularly addressing three different technical challanges.
    * the OverHead Reduction for Massive Machine to Machine (MTM) Communication Systems.
    * the latency reduction for critical MTM communication systems in the wide area in context.
    * interfacing towards the Critical Application.
    
   
5- Course Wrap-Up
    * summary of the course
    * we look into some current research topics such as dependable wireless networks, Security and privacy 
    for URLLC and dependable, mobile edge computing architectures.
    
 
 Pre-course requirements:
    * no specific prerequisite is needed.
    * the basis of data networking, in particular, the layered approaches to a network stack.
    * the basics of wireless communications (wireless channel, modulation, and coding medium access 
    control approaches)
