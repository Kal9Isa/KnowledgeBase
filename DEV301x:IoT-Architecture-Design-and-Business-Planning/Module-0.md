# **IoT Architecture Design and Business Planning**

## **Course Syllabus**

### **[Module 1: Understanding the IoT Reference Architecture]()**

* The first module provides an overview of the IoT Reference Architecture, introducing Things, Insights and Actions. 
With a basic understanding of the architecture, students will examine the core and optional subsystems, cross-cutting 
concerns, principles and concepts of the Reference Architecture, and architecture of key subsystems

    - Lab 1: Architecture Overview
    - Lab 2: Reference Architecture Subsystems and Security
    - Lab 3: Pillars of Software Quality
    - Lab 4: Implementing Redundancy


### **[Module 2: Exploring Solutions]()**

* In the second module, students will use the Remote Monitoring Solution Accelerator to explore the receipt and processing 
of remote device telemetry (the most common scenario for IoT) within the context of the Reference Architecture. Students 
will identify the areas of alignment and where the solution departs from the reference, as well as the tools used to deploy 
the solution. The student will then review some of the options for customizing the Remote Monitoring solution and complete 
some customization activities. Finally, the student will review additional accelerator solutions and learn when they may be applicable.

    - Lab 1: Remote Monitoring Solution Accelerator
    - Lab 2: Customize a Solution Accelerator
    - Lab 3: Connected Factory and IoT


### **[Module 3: Requirements and RFPs]()**

* In module three, students are introduced to approaches that can be used to determine and document the business and system 
requirements that will drive key factors such as security, scalability, availability, and disaster recovery service level 
agreements. They will then apply the requirements, develop a candidate architecture, build a PoC, deliver a cost analysis, 
and evaluate against quality measures. To finish up the module, students will propose the IoT Hub Operations, Monitoring and 
Security Processes and Procedures to support the candidate architecture.

    - Lab 1: Understanding Requirements
    - Lab 2: Understanding an RFP
    - Lab 3: Responding to an RFP


### **[Module 4: Proof of Value and Rollout]()**

* In the final module, students will take their defined business requirements and examine how to apply their understanding 
of IoT Architecture and the capabilities of Azure IoT to create a compelling proposal. They will learn the key attributes 
of the Azure Cloud and the Azure IoT architecture that should be emphasized, approaches for developing the cost of a proposal 
and other factors such as support. Students will also consider the steps necessary for moving from a Proof of Concept to a full 
rollout and how to support the solution.

    - Lab 1: Planning a PoV
    - Lab 2: Rollout to Production
    - Lab 3: Scaling to Needs
    - Lab 4: Retiring Assets
