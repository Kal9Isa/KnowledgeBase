    * Health care operations activities.

* HIPAA consists of over 508 rules.

## **Why is HIPAA Necessary**

* Why?

    * Prior to 1996 there was no legislation restricting the manner
      in which a patient's healthcare related information was shared,
      distributed, stored or protected.

        * Enforced in 2003.

    * To protect the individual

        * Protecting personal privacy is to protect the interests and
        dignity of individuals.

        * To protect identity of the patients such as name, SSN from
        identity theft or other threats.

    * To benefit society through furthering research ethically.

        * Protecting patients involved in research from harm and 
        preserving their rights is essential to ethical research.

## **What is HIPAA Privacy Rule**

 * HIPAA

    * Federally enacted in 1996 and strictly enforced since 2003.

    * Protects Protected Health Inforamtion (PHI)

    * Two main elements:

        * Privacy rule

        * Security rule

* What is PHI?

    * Health information, including demographic information.

    * Relates to an individual's physical or mental health or the
    provision of or payment for health care.

    * Identifies the individual.

    * 18 Elements considered in PHI

        1- Names

        2- All geographical subdivisions smaller than a state, including
        street address, city, county,precinct, zip code, etc.

        3- All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related 
        to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge
        date, date of death.

        4- Phone numbers

        5- Fax numbers

        6- Email addresses

        7- Social Security Number

        8- Medical record numbers

        9- Health plan beneficiary numbers

        10- Account numbers

        11- Certificate/license numbers

        12- Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate
        numbers.

        13- Device identifiers and serial numbers.

        14- Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)

        15- IP address numbers

        16- Biometric identifiers including voice and finger prints.

        17- Full face photographic images and any comparable image.

        18- Any other unique identifying number, characteristics, or code
        (note that this does not mean the unique code assigned by the
        investigator to code the data)

* HIPAA - The Privacy Rule

    * Also known as Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health
    Information.

    * Issued by the Department of Health and Human services (HHS) as a set of
    national standards for protection of certain health inforamtion.

    * The Privacy Rule standards address the use and disclosure of individual's
    health information (PHI) by organizations subject to the privacy rule called
    "Covered Entities".

    * Provide assurance that individual's health inforamtion is properly protected.

    * Must also consider the necessary flow of health information needed to provide
    and promote high quality health care and protect the public's health and well 
    being.

* The Privacy Rule and Notice of Privacy Practices (NOPP)

    * The HIPAA Privacy rule gives individuals a fundamental right to be informed 
    of the privacy practices of their health plans, their healthcare providers, as
    well as to be informed of their privacy rights with respect to PHI.

    * the NOPP must be provided to patients who request this information and post
    prominently on its website.

    * Notice of Privacy Practices must be in plain language:

        * Provide adequate notice of how a covered entity may use and disclose PHI.

        * Indicate his/her rights and the covered entity's obligations in relation
        to that information.

## **What is HIPAA Security Rule**

* HIPAA - The Security Rule

    * Protect the privacy of individual's health information.

    * Allow enough flexibility to allow for growth and new technologies.

    * Requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to 
    ensure the confidentiality, integrtiy, availability and security of electronic PHI.

* 4 Basic Requirements

    1- Ensure the confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of all e-PHI they create,
    receive, maintain or transmit.

    2- Identify and Protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the security or
    the integrity of information.

    3- Protect against reasonably anticipated, impermissible uses or disclosures.

    4- Ensure compilance by their workforce.

* Privacy vs. Security: the difference

    * The Privacy rule focuses on the right of an individuls to control the USE of his/her
      personal information. PHI should not be divulged or used by others against their wishes.

        * The Privacy rule covers the confidentiality of PHI in all formats including electronic,
        paper and oral.

        * Confidentiality is an assurance that the information will be protected from unauthorized
        disclosure. the physical security of PHI in ALL FORMATS is an element of the Privacy rule.

    * The Security rule focuses on administrative, technical and physical SAFEGUARDS specifically 
      as the relate to ELECTRONIC. Protection of ePHI data from unauthorized access, whether external
      or internal, stored or in transit, is all part of the security rule. Typically ePHI is stored in:

        * Computer hard drives.

        * Magnetic tapes, disks, memory cards.

        * Any kind of removable/transportable digital memory media.

        * All transmission media used to exchange information such as the internet, leased lines,
        dial-up, intranet and private networks.

## **How: Security Rule**

* The Security rule requires layers of protection for PHI:

    * Physical

    * Administrative

    * Technical

* Physical Safeguards

    * Facility Access and Control. A covered entity must limit physical access to its facilities while
    ensuring that authorized access is allowed.

    * Workstation and Device Security. A covered entity must implement policies and procedures to 
    specify proper use of and access to workstations and electronic media. A covered entity also 
    must have in place policies and procedures regarding the transfer, removal, disposal, and 
    re-use of electronic media, to ensure appropriate protection of ePHI.

* Administrative Safeguards

    * Security Management Process: a covered entity must identify and analyze potential risks to ePHI
      and it must implement security meausres that reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and 
      appropriate level.

        * It comes down to Risk Management:

            * Risk Assesment: Identify your assets and figure out how they work.

            * Risk Analysis: Look at your threats and vulnerabilities, what's the potential for loss.

            * Risk Mitigation: How can we in a cost-effective manner mitigate the risks so they fall in 
            our tolerance level.

            * This is an ongoing process.

    * Security Personnel: A covered entity must designate a security official who is responsible for
      developing and implementing its security policies and procedures.

        * Senior Management is responsible for Security.

    * Information Access Management: Consistent with the Privacy Rule standard limiting uses and disclosures
    of PHI to the "minimun necessary", the Security Rule requires a covered entity to implement policies
    and procedures for authorizing access to ePHI only when such access is appropriate based on the user's
    or recipient's role. (Role-based Access)

    * Workforce Training and Management: A covered entity must provide for appropriate authorization and 
    supervision of workforce members who work with ePHI. A covered entity must train all workforce 
    members regarding its security policies and procedures, and must have and apply appropriate sanctions
    against members who violate its policies and procedures.

    * Evaluation: A covered entity must perform a periodic assessment of how well its security policies and
    procedures meet the requirements of the Security Rule.


## **How: Technical Safeguards and Consent**

* Technical Safeguards

    * Access Control: A covered entity must implement technical policies and procedures that allow only 
      authorized persons to access ePHI.

        * Elements of Access Control:

            * Identification

            * Authentication

            * Accountability

    * Audit Control: A covered entity must implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms
    to record and examine access and other activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

    * Integrity Control: A covered entity must implement policies and procedures to ensure that ePHI 
    is not improperly altered or destroyed. Electronic measures must be put in place to confirm that
    ePHI has not been improperly modified.

    * Transmission Security: A covered entity must implement technical security measures that guard
    against unauthorized access to ePHI that is being transmitted over an electronic network.

* If you don't need it, don't store it; if you do, protect it.

    * Minimum Necessary: A covered entity must develop policies and procedures that reasonably limits
    its disclosure of, and requests for, protected health information for payment and healthcare 
    operations to the minimum necessary.

    * Principle pf Least Privilege: A covered entity also is required to develop role-based access 
    policies and procedures that limit which members of its workforce may have access to protected 
    health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations, based on those who need
    access to the information to do their jobs. However, covered entities are not required to apply
    the minimum necssary standard to disclosures to or requested by a healthcare provider for 
    treatment purposes.

* Get Consent

    * Consent: A covered entity may voluntarily choose, but is not required, to obtain the individual's
    consent for it to use and disclose information about him/her for treatment, payment, and healthcare 
    operations. A covered entity that chooses to have a consent process has completed discretion under 
    the Privacy Rule to design a process that works best for its business adn consumers. A "consent" 
    document is not a valid permission to use or disclose protected health information for a purpose 
    that requires an "authorization" under the Privacy Rule.

    * Any use or disclosure of protected health information for treatment, payment or healthcare 
    operations must be consistent with the covered entity's notice of privacy practices. A covered 
    entity is required to provide the individual with adequate notice of its privacy practices, including
    the uses or disclosures the covered entity may make of the individual's information and the individual's
    rights with respect to that information.

## **To Whom does HIPAA Apply**

        * A Business Associate Agreement must be in place between the business associate and the subcontractor 
        to protect confidentiality regarding all PHI.

## **Can You Share PHI**

* Can PHI be shared without the patient's consent?

    * To avoid interfering with an individual's access to quality healthcare, or the efficient payment for
    such healthcare, the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to use and disclose protected health information,
    with certain limits and protections.

    * A covered entity may, without the individual's authorization may share a limited information:

        * To the individual patient

        * Treatment

        * Payment

        * Healthcare operations activities.

    * Certain limitaitons to exactly what and how that information can be shared is further defined under 
    the Privacy Rule.

* The individual patient

    * Besides required disclosures, covered entities also may disclose PHI to their patient/health plan 
    enrollments.

* Treatment

    * Generally means the provision, coordination, or management of healthcare and related services among
    healthcare providers or by a healthcare provider with a 3rd party, consultation between healthcare 
    providers regarding a patient, or the referral of patient from one healthcare provider to another.

* Payment

    * It encompasses the various activities of healthcare providers to obtain payment or be reimbursed for 
      their services and of a health plan to obtain premiums, to fulfill their coverage responsibilities
      and provide benefits under the plan, and to obtain or provide, reimbursement for the provision of 
      healthcare. In addition to general definiton, the Privacy Rule provides examples:

        * Determinig eligibility or coverage under a plan and adjudicating claims.

        * Billing and collection activities.

        * Reviewing healthcare services for medical necessity, coverage, justification of charges and the like.
