# **Service Design**

## **Goals and Processes**

* Main Processes

    * Design Coordination

        - Coordinate all service design activities, processes and resources.

        - Ensure the consistent and effective design of new or changed IT services.

        - Design coordination support

            - Coordinate all service design activities, processes and resources.

        - Service Design Planning

            - Plan design activities in detail. Make sure that all relevant aspects
            are considered.

            - An outcome of this process would be WBS - Work Breakdown Structure -
            diagrams.

        - Design coordination monitoring

            - Record the activities performed in various SD processes.

            - Determine if the new or changed service can be provided economically.

        - Organizational service design

            - Determines how a new service will be provided from an IT perspective.

        - Design review and RFC submission

            - Submit the service design package to a final review.

            - Submit a formal RFC - Request for Change -.

            - Initiate the implementation of the service.

        - Service Design Package - SDP

            - Builds upon the Service Level Requirements.

            - Specifies the requirements from the viewpoint of the client.

            - Defines how these are actually fulfilled from a technical and
            organizational point of view.

    * Service Catalog Management

        - Ensure that a service catalog is produced and maintained.

            - Containing accurate information on all operational services and those
            being prepared to be run operationally and have SDPs ready.

            - Provides vital information for all other service management processes,
            service details, current status and the services interdependencies.

        - No subprocesses.

    * Service Level Management

        - ![SLA management](http://www.rightstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ServiceLevel_graphic.jpg)

            - Design and maintain the underlying structure of the customer agreement
            portfolio.

            - Provide templates for the various SLM documents.

        - Identification of service requirements

            - Capture desired outcomes (requirements from the customer viewpoint)
            for new services or major service modifications.

            - Requirements are documented and submitted to an initial evaluation.

            - Allows for alternatives to be sought at an early stage for requirements
            which are not technically or economically feasible.

        - Agreement sign-off and service activation

            - Have all relevant contracts signed off after completion of service
            transition.

            - Make sure that all relevant OLAs are signed off by their service
            owners, and that the SLA is signed off by the customer.

        - Service level monitoring and reporting

            - Monitor achieved service levels and compare them with agreed service
            level targets.

    * Risk Management

        - Aims to inform management about operational risks. Not official, yet.

        - Risk management support

            - Define a framework for risk management.

            - Specify how risk is quantified, what risks the organization is willing
            to accept, and who is in charge of the various risk management duties.

        - Impact/Risk analysis

            - Quantify the impact to the business that a loss of service or asset
            would have.

            - Determine the likelihood of a threat or vulnerability to actually occur.

            - Produces the business impact analysis.

        - Assessment of mitigations

            - Determine where risk mitigation measures are required, and which risks
            to take.

            - Identify risk owners who will be responsible for their implementation
            and ongoing maintenance.

        - Risk monitoring

        - Ensure that the IT service provider can always provide minimum agreed
        service levels.

        - ITSCM support

            - Make sure that all members of IT staff with responsibilities for
            fighting disasters are aware of their exact duties.

            a disaster occurs.

        - Design services for Continuity

            - Design appropriate and cost-justifiable continuity mechanisms and
            procedures to meet the agreed business continuity targets.

            - Include design for risk reduction measures and recovery plans.

        - ITSCM Training and testing

            - Make sure that all preventive measures and recovery mechanisms for
            the case of disaster events are subject to regular testing.

            - Verify disaster prevention measures are still in line with risk
            perceptions from the business side.

    * Information Security Management

        - Allignment is key.

            - All ITSM processes must include information security management.

            - Executive management is ultimately responsible.

            - Corporate Governance consists of:

                - Business Processes

        chapter.

        - No sub-processes.

        * On-Site vs Off-Site

            - Architecture management in the Cloud has some special cases:

                - Service Architecture needs to be flexible enough to change
                Cloud providers without architecture changes.

                - Must account for proprietary information being stored/run off-site.

## **KPIs and Monitoring**

* KPIs of Service Level Management

    - % of Services covered by an SLA (PSlaC)

        - # of services w/ SLA / # total services

        - 0 <= PSlaC <= 1.0

    - % of Services with OLA/UC - Operational Level Agreement/Underlying Contract -
    (PUcC)

        - # of services w/ OLA/UC / # total services

        - 0 <= PUcC <= 1.0

    - # SLAs under review (CSlaR)

    - % of fulfilled SLAs (PFSla)

        - # of services SLAs met / # total services w/ SLAs

        - 0 <= PFSla <= 1.0

    * Relationship between different service level states:

        - Total

        - Covered overlaps with Under Review:

            - Fulfilled overlaps with OLA/UC, Under Review.

            - OLA/UC overlaps with Under Review

        - Under Review

* KPIS of Capacity Management

    - # of capacity shortages (CCshrt)

    - # Deviation from expectation (CEDev)

        - # Expected Cap. Req. - Actual Cap. Req.

        - Over util. < 0 < Under util.

    * Notes on Capacity Management

        - Auto-scaling removes the manual work, not the needs to use KPIs.

        - Understanding capacity change leads to better horizontal scaling.

        - Add KPI for

            - % Cap. reserve when util. = Mean (PCRmean)

                - # reserve resrc - (sum(mean(util.)) / # days observed)

                - # reserv resrc at time x [x figured by the time frame the average
                number of users were on the service.]

            - % Cap. reserved util. = Max (PCRMax)

                - Same concept, but when service utilization is at maximum.

            - informs budgeting, Security, Ops.

            - Capacity planning on-site comes in the form of VM server automation.
            Off-site involves automatic instantiation services.
