## **Goals and Processes**

* ![Phase Goal](https://i0.wp.com/www.e-qms.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/steps-in-continuous-improvement-process.jpg?resize=768%2C487&ssl=1)

    - Plan: How can a current process be improved?

    - Do: Implement changes on a small scale

    - Check: Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness.

    - Act: Implement successful changes on a wider scale.

* Processes:

    - Service Review

        - Review services and infrastructure components on a regular basis.

        - Improve service quality where necessary.

        - identify more economical ways of providing a service where possible.

        - No subprocesses.

    - Process Evaluation

        - Evaluate the processes used through the service life cycle.

        - Identifying areas where the targeted process metrics are not reached.

        - holding regular benchmark tests, audits, maturity assessments and reviews.

        - Subprocesses:

            - Process management support

                - Support all parties involved in managing and improving processes, in
                particular the process owners.

                - Coordinate all modifications to processes and update the process
                architecture.

                - Make sure that all processes cooperate in a seamless way.

            - Process benchmarking

                - Evaluate processes in relation to comparable organizations.

                - Identify shortcomings and develop plans for improvement.

            - Process Maturity assessment

                - Evaluate processes in relation to best practices.

                - Identify shortcomings and develop plans for Improvements (Process
                Evaluation Report).

            - Process Audit

                - Perform process audits in order to certify compliance of the
                processes with certain standards or regulatory requirements.

            - Process control and review

                - Submit processes to regular reviews. Identify process weaknesses
                which should be addressed by process improvement initiatives.

            - Definition of CSI initiatives

                - Define specific initiatives to improve services and processes,
                based on the results of service reviews and process evaluations.

                - Can result in internal initiatives, or initiatives which require
                the customer's cooperation.

                - No subprocesses.

            - CSI initiative monitoring

                - Verify improvement initiatives are proceeding according to plan.

                - Introduce corrective measures as necessary.

## **KPIs and Monitoring**

* Service Review KPIs

    - # of service reviews completed (CSRC)

    - # of services with deficiencies identified (CSID)

        - Can calculate % as CSID / # total services

    - # of deficiencies identified in reviews (CDIR)

        - Broken out by service

    - Mean number of deficiencies per service (MDPS)

        - Sum(CDIR) / # total services

* Process Evaluation KPIs

    - # of process reviews completed (CPRC)

        - Broken out by review type (benchmark, Audit, etc.)

    - # of process deviations discovered (CPDD)

    - # of process Improvements identified (CPII)

    - % of process improvements Implemented (PPII)

        - # Implemented improvements / CPII

* Definition of CSI Initiative KPIs

    - # of ongoing CSI initiatives

    - # of completed CSI initiatives
