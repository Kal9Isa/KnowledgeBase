# **ITIL RACI Construction**

## **Responsibility Assignment Matrices**

* What is it?

    - Also called a RACI matrix or Linear Responsibility Chart (LRC)

    - Defines which roles are responsible for which processes/ subprocesses.

    - Key Roles:

        - R = Responsible - Does work to complete task.

        - A = Accountable - Ultimately responsible for the correct completion
        of a deliverable.

        - C = Consulted - Subject Matter Expert who's opinion is sought.

        - I = Informed - Everyone to be kept up-to-date on the process.

* Building the Matrices

    - Stored in DBMSs.

    - Left hand column (vertical axis) is processes, subprocesses, or tasks from
    a WBS.

    - Column headers are the roles in the organization (from the organizational
    chart)

    - Cell values are the position in the organization responsible for that role
    in that task.

    - Positions != specific people (Sales Manager vs. John Doe).

    - Break them up by business unit if working with big companies.

* Alternatives

    - PACSI - Useful to organizations where the output of activities under the
    accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by
    multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture.

        - Perform - The role carrying out the activity.

        - Accountable - The role ultimately responsible for the correct completion
        of a deliverable. Often delegates work to the performer.

        - Control - The roles reviewing the result of the activity (other than
        accountable). They have a right of veto. Advice is binding. (have to follow
        their opinion)

        - Suggest - The role consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise.
        Advice is non-binding.

        - Informed - The role who must be informed of the result of the activity.

    - RASCI - Expanded version of the standard RACI model. Breaks the responsible
    participation roles into:

        - Responsible - The role who ensures that a task is done per the Approver.

        - Support - Resources allocated to the Responsible participant. Unlike,
        Consulted, support helps complete the task.

    - RACIQ - Adds a Quality Review participant.

    - RACI-VS - Adds a participant to verify and a final sign-off participant.

    - RACIO - Adds an Omitted participation role which is the opposite of the
    Informed participant role.
