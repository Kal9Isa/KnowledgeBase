# **What in the World is IoT**

## **Barcelnoa: A smart city**

* The Smart City of today can perhaps best be described 
as a city planning/urban development methodology heavily 
relying on ICT to gather necessary input and make optimal
engineering and planning decisions.

* For additional reading:

    * Smart Cities: Concepts and Challanges: Bases for the
    Assesment of Smart City Projects article from Springer.

* The term Smart Building is loosely tossed around alot, but
it generally refers to network-enabled building management
systems that help automate building operations.

    * Light over Ethernet by Philips was used in "The Edge"
    building in Amsterdam to allow power to flow from Ethernet 
    to lights from one side and data to flow from the lights on 
    the other side.

    * Hot Desking - when the desks are only used when they're 
    needed.

## **IoT Case Studies**

* **Sydney Harbour Brdige**

    * IoT solution is used to monitor how the bridge is dealing
    with the increased freight loads and traffic volumes.

    * over 3200 sensors are used to measure vibrations and how 
    the structure responds to it and all are connected by fiber 
    optic cables.

* **Agriculture: Dairy Farm**

    * Used in a dairy farm to monitor milk production, cows and 
    birth control, their food, their health and its tracked by a
    responder that is equipped with a motion sensor and transponder
    so all their data is sotred an accessible through different 
    applications.

* **Health: Foot Drop Project**

    * using sensors on patients with gait abnormality knows as 
    foot drop. (dropping of the fore foot in walking patterns).
    To track the movement patterns and muscle movements, wearable
    sensors are used to capture the data.

* **Industry: Smart Monitoring and Asset Management**

    * Industrial machines need a predictive maintanance schedule
    to prevent them from getting damaged and using sensors that are
    communicating their condition on the networks can help wiht this
    task.

    * Wind turbines could use sensors to determine whether a part 
    needs to be changed or not, before it damages the whole system.
    or if some accident occurs like lighting, technicians are able 
    to track this system's behavior and determine whether its working
    properly or not. Wind turbines have a history of burning down because 
    gearbox and moving parts heating up and burning th oil and causing
    damages to the turbine.
    
    * In Hospitals managing resources and asset tracking using smart tags
    could lead to increased patient quality care.
