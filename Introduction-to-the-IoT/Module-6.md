# **All Together Now**

## **Introduction**

* All together now

    * In this module we will look at some design thinking and planning 
      for IoT. You will:

        * Be introduced to design considerations for the IoT.

        * Discover what electronics are required for IoT prototyping.

## **Devices + Network + Data + Programming + Security = IoT**

* Planning for IoT Design

    * There are many factors to consider in the planning phase. Whatever
      IoT innovation you have in mind should, above all, provide a benefit
      or solve a problem such as:

        - Saving resources.

        - Perfoming a job better/more efficently.

        - Advancing knowledge

    * Filling out the IoT Design Template, helps you gather ideas and answer
    important questions.

    * Use Case: Dairy Farm IoT Design Template

        - Security and Privacy Considerations:

            - Device

            - Network

            - Data

* Process: Idea to Working Model

    * Handisco is a smart assistant for visually impaired people. It was
    designed to help these people achieve more in the city. And it uses 
    Bluetooth to connect the stick to their phone.

* Design Considerations for Assistive Technology

    * Three major issues with IoT:

        - Security

        - Privacy

        - Interoperability

    * Interoperability is the ability of different software and technology to
    communicate.

    * Assistive technology software is used to support people with disabilities,
    and how they interact with a particular device.

* Redesigning Everyday Objects

    * HitIQ, connected to the skull through the upper jaw and integrated with 
    motion sensors, the Nexus A9 detects both linear and rotational accelerations
    in head impacts. Then it's communicated via Bluetooth to a sideline device in
    nearly real-time so medical personnel can make more informed decisions regarding
    concussion assessment.

## **Project Concept Planning**

* Project Concept Planning

    * For an IoT project to be successful, it is vital that your IoT solution addresses
    a real problem, or provides a real benefit or efficiency in an existing progress. 
    It helps to find your target audience and their requirements.

    * On top of that, it's also important to know, what makes your product better that 
    what is currently available.

* IoT Business Plans

    * Canvanizer is a free online product that allows you to workout rough, one-page
    business plans.

    * Guide on how to fill the form:

* Unique Value Propositions

    * It's also called Unique Selling Proposition (USP), Differentiating your project 
    from others on the market.

## **Electronics for the IoT**

* IoT Development Kit Component

    * There are 3 types of development projects in IoT:

        1- Cloud Connected: These can be as vast as  a network of systems located all over
        the world, all connected to a cloud infrastructure. This cloud infrastructure can 
        consist of one or more serevrs running server applications that analyze and process
        the collected data.

        2- Local Networked: Small embedded systems that are remote sensors for a larger system,
        often in an internet.

        3- Gateways: These are systems that connects a legacy application to the internet.

    * Microprocessors contain microcontrollers and are general purpose, however, microcontrollers
    have one or more CPUs along with a Memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program 
    memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included.

    * In this Specialization we use:

        * Arduino Uno starter kit

        * Raspberry Pi 3 B

        * Idunio's 37 in 1 sensor kit for Arduino
