Network Media
    - Twisted Pair cable: most common media used in Ethernet Networking is an Unshielded Twisted 
    Pair (UTP) cable which is made up of a series of wires (8 wires), that are arranged in pairs 
    to reduce interference. and each pair is color coded so we have the same pattern on either end of 
    the cable. typically in each pair, one of the wires is a solid color and its partner is the 
    same color striped onto a whie background.
    most common connector used in networking,on each end of the cable which connects devices 
    to the cable, is a RJ45 connector.
    
    - Coaxial copper cabling: it's the most commonly used cable for TVs and cameras or satellite
    communication systems and has two different connectors: BNC, screw on F type. the rigid core 
    which is made up of copper/aluminum conducts the signal, it's also insulated by a plastic layer 
    and a braided metal mesh on top to deal with electromagnetic interference of the enviornment and 
    a protective jacket. it is used as a high-frequency trasnmission line to carry high-frequency 
    or broadband signals. also coax provides improved shielding compared to UTP and therefore can 
    carry more data.

    - Fiber optic cable: is made either of glass/plastic and it has a solid core and is surronded 
    by second layer of glass/plastic to provide the reflective surface to carry patterns of light.
    it's usually used for long distances. either lasers or LEDs are used to generate light pulses.
    the jacket is usually made up of PVC, the core is made of silica or glass.

    - The 4 main criteria for choosing network meida are:
        * The distance the media can successfully carry a signal.
        * The enviornment in which the media is to be installed.
        * The amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmited.
        * The cost of the media installation.

Twisted-Pair Cables
    - Data transmission over copper cable is sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI),
    which can reduce the data throughput rate that a cable can provide. 
    
    - Crosstalk is a source of interference which occurs when cables are bundled together for 
    long lengths. The electrical impulses from one cable can cross over to an adjacent cable.
    this occurs frequently when cables are improperly installed and terminated.
    
    - there are two common types of TP:
        * Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
        * Shielded cables (STP)
    
    - the most common number of pairs in a TP cable is 4.
    
    - the most commonly used categories include 3,5,5e and 6.

    - when there are electrical enviornments in which EMI and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) 
    are so strong that shielding is a requirement to make communication possible, we use STP.
    
    - two common connectors are RJ45 (used commonly with computers) and RJ11 (used with phones 
    and fax machines).

Wiring Schemes of UTP
    - the color coding of the wire pairs is determined by the type of standard that is used to make 
    the cable. 
    
    - the TIA/EIA organization defines two different patterns for Ethernet installations called:
        * T568A
            P3 P3 P2 P1 P1 P2 P4 P4
            GW G OW  B BW  O BrW Br
            1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
            
        * T568B
            P2 P2 P3 P1 P1 P3 P4 P4
            OW O GW  B  BW G BrW Br
            1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
        
        * https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0JdEL9sREeasvA5WOAljNg_ab5fc08a8fcdd6369a826d8ddae85764_2341.JPG?expiry=1553558400000&hmac=LmBj176haciP4L52kPOpqVQ08NRxkUcuZP0NHYm-l-E
        
    that each scheme defines the pinouts or order of wire connections on the end of the cable.
    
    - it is important that the same wiring should be used for every termination in the project.
  

Sending Data on UTP Cabling
    - specific pins on the connectors are associated with a transmit function and a receive 
    function. the interfaces on each device are designed to transmit and receive data on 
    designated wires within the cable.
    
    - when two devices are directly connected using an UTP cable, it is important that the 
    transmit function and the receive function on each end of the cable are reversed.
    
    - two devices that use different wires for transmit and receive are known as "Unlike Devices".
    they require a "Straight-through" cable to exchange data. straight-through cables have same 
    color patterns on both ends of the cable.
    
    - devicess that are directly connected and use the same pins for transmit and receive are
    known as "Like Devices". they require the use of "Crossover" cable in order to reverse the 
    transmit function and receive function so that devices can exchange data.

What Does Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mean?
    - if hosts runs both server applications and client applications in a network, the network 
    is of P2P type.

Ping Command
    - the ping utility tests end-to-end connectivity between the IP address of the source of the 
    message and the IP address of its destination. it measures the time that it takes test messages 
    to make a round trip from the source to destination and whether or not the transmission is 
    successful.
    
    - the format of the ping command si universally implemented:
         ping <domain-name>/<IP address>
         
    - the name "Ping" refers to Sonar systems and when they ping whenever sth is detected.
    

Following the Path
    - the "Traceroute" utility traces the route a message takes from its source to the destination. 
    each individual network through which the message travels is referred to as a "Hop". Traceroute 
    displays each hop along the way and the time it takes for the message to get to the network and
    back.
    
    - if a problem occurs, use the output of the traceroute utility to help determine where a message 
    was lost or delayed.
    
    - to use traceroute in different OSes:
        * Windows: >tracert <domain-name>/<IP address>
        * Mac: $traceroute <domain-name>/<IP address>
        * Linux: $traceroute <domain-name>/<IP address>
